## Websocket GUI
Goal for this is to be somewhat like Postman. To say this is in the earliest stages would be an understatement. It works, but I threw it together quickly to test out multiple websocket connections locally for my company's SaaS product. To say the least - it's incredibly ugly. More to come.
